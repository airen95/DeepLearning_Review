# DeepLearning_Review.

This repository is created to look over what I have acquired in the field of Deep Learning using Tensorflow and Keras.\

1.The first assigment HandWriting_ANN is to build simple one-layer ANN to predict the handwritten digit dataset.

2.The second assigment Cifar10 uses the embedded Cifar10 dataset from Tensorflow.

In the first attemp, i tried to use two-layer ANN to classify object with 10 ouputs. Howerver, since the prediction accuracy seemed pretty low (under 50%)\
I built the model again using CNN  which increased the accuracy considerably (~70%).

Appreciated to the creator ðŸ”Š Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/codebasicshub\
as his concise and simple videos have clarified a lot of abstract concepts for me.\

I also use https://phamdinhkhanh.github.io/deepai-book/intro.html to compare and review knowldege in math definition.\

Last but not least, my big thanks to the so-called old friend Tonlee for his unconditional support.
